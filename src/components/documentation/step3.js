        <h1>Step 3: Uploading your experiments to GitHub.</h1>
        <br />
        <p>
          After successfully downloading your experiments from Pavlovia and
          adding the lib folder, it is now time to upload those experiments on
          the hosting service GitHub. We will also use one of its features,
          ‘GitHub Pages,’ to publish the experiment and create a global link for
          it so that it is easily accessible and can be added to the ‘Sans
          Tracas’ platform.
        </p>
        <p>
          Follow along the steps of this article to learn how to upload your
          experiment to GitHub and publish it to obtain a global link.

                  pre-requisite section, and if you have not created an account
                  yet, you could create one by clicking on “sign up” instead of
                  “sign in.”
